[size=14pt][color=#337ab7]Masternode made different[/color][/size]

[b][color=#00b4b5]P[/color][color=#91b72e]e[/color][color=#fdb813]n[/color][color=#eb7424]t[/color][color=#c51553]a[/color][/b]node is a Crypto-currency ecosystem based on a brand new concept, [b]Tiered Masternodes[/b].

Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, Pentanode is a Proof-of-Stake cryptocurrency using flexible collateral masternode system.

When standard crypto are using a fixed amount of coins as collateral, Pentanode offers to setup 5 different masternodes, granting 5 different staking rewards. The more you invest, the more you are rewarded. But we are also open to small budget, allowing everyone to setup masternode at low cost.

With Pentanode, you can setup a masternode with only 2500 coins, but if you want to go big, you can also setup a masternode with 25 000 coins. Of course biggest players get biggest rewards, a 25k masternode is rewarding as much as 17.5 times a 2,5k one.

If you like masternode coins, if you see masternodes like a nice passive income, Pentanode is made for you !

Don't hesitate to learn more by reading our reward system and go setup your pentanode masternode to get involved in our project and earn your share !

[size=24pt][color=#00b4b5]Reward ladder[/color][/size][/td][/tr][/table]

Pentanode reward is based on Masternode type and block number. Let's see how this works :

[size=14pt][color=#337ab7]Block number is lower than 15 000[/color][/size]
Only [b]Silver masternodes[/b] are activated but they receive Bronze masternodes rewards. Each block is generating 25 coins when mined, 20 goes to masternodes, 5 for stakers. 
1440 blocks are mined every day, generating 36 000 coins to be shared between masternodes.

[size=14pt][color=#337ab7]Block number is between 15 000 and 35 000[/color][/size]
Only [b]Silver masternodes[/b] are activated but they receive Gold masternodes rewards. Each block is generating 125 coins when mined, 120 goes to masternodes, 5 for stakers. 
1440 blocks are mined every day, generating 172 800 coins to be shared between masternodes.

[size=14pt][color=#337ab7]Block number is greater than 35 000[/color][/size]
[b]All masternode tiers are activated. [/b]
